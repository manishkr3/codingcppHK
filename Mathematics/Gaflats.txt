#if output is not coming then
for loop infinite loop;check once again what you are inputing
if condition = in place of == which always returns a tru condition and cause a logical erroa or 
syntactical may be

in leet code test case matterrs a lot (around 361 for one code) therefore be prepared especially
for empty and single elemented arrays.

//!code rules
variables
    - should be descriptive as far as possible like age,name not a,n etc.
    - boolean variables should be named in the form of a question eg. isPermanantEmployee,isAdult etc
    - use Plural for lists, arrays, vectors eg: vector<int>heights, vector<Strudent> students, etc
    - choose a camel case naming style for function and variables.
functions:
    - should be named according to the format <verb><noun> eg. getMarks, computeSalary, updateAge
    - functions should do only one thing and do it well.
    - functions should not be more than 7 lines long (main function can be max 10 lines)
    - should follow ORP(one responsibility principle) i.e. it should do only one thing and do it well.
Classes:
    - use Pascal naming style to name your classes eg.Student,VehicleTime
    - 
Global variables:
    - they are safety hazards in your code.
    - keep the scope of your variable as limited as possible.
    - only constants are allowed to kept global.
Imports:
    - only include files which you are using.
    - do not include "bits/stdc++.h" header file
Tips:
    - using the modern c++ syntax whenever possible
    - using range based loops over iterator based 
    - use classes over structs
    - passing constant references as they are more efficient  
    - it is a good practice to put conditions for all of the corner cases
    - //ye kya bakwas sa scene h re if you are writing only definitions for functions and want to use one 
      function in other one then declare it before the other or declare this function at start and define later.
      ab samajh aya meko why aisa hota h ki declare alag se karo or define alag se - so that scope problem will
      be resolved because cpp runs line by line. 
                                    



competitive programming setup:


    #ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
    freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
    freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
    #endif


and create or automatically gets created input.txt and output.txt in the same directory.
