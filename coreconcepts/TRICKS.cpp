//abs(3-4) is like modulus function and thus returns always positive value.
// /*max_element(a,a+n) returns max element similarly *min_element(a,a+n) returns 
//element.
//reverse(a,a+n),
//by default array passes as pointer call by reference
//sort(a,a+n) sort(a,a+n,greater<int>())
//count(a,a+n,3) last is number to be counted
//!unordered_map has less complexity then map arond logN less because it does not has
//!hassle of keeping map sorted.
