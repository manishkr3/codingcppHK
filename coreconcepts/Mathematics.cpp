 1. Prime Number - they are the numbers which can only divided by exactly two numbers - 1 and
  number itself. 1 is not a prime number because it can only be divided by one number . 0 again
  can't be divided by anything. Therefore our range comes out to be [0,âˆž]. alt + 236 on numpad.
  *for chicking the number is prime or not we have to only go loop for sqrt(x) ,see that non-prime number have at least two factors other than 1 ,
  *so n=sqrt(n)*sqrt(n) , therefore the factor other than number must liie in the 0 to sqrt(n)
