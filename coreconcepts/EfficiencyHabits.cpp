/* array limitations:
1.fixed size
2.contiguous block of memory required every time
3.insertion and deletion is very costly
linked list is solution of all these
4.your code should as descriptive as you can make it
5.boolean variables should be named in the form of question eg. 'isAdult' 'isPermanent'
6.use plural names for vector,lists and array eg. vector<int> numbers, vector<Student> students
7.file names
    use snake_case to name file
8.functions:
    - functions should be named according to format <verb><noun> eg. getMarks, computeSalary, updateAge
    - functions should do one thing and do it well
    - should be lowerCamelCase
9.classes:
    - classes introduce new data type in the language
    - name your classes to describe the data type introduced.
    - use PascalCase or UpperCamelCase naming style to name classes
10.Variables
    - they should written in lowerCamelCase
    - fuction's first word is verb but variables should start with noun.
10.Global Variables
    - global variables are safety hazard in your code.
    - keep the scope of your variables as limited as possible.//can use static in classes
    - only constants are allowed to kept global
11.Readability
    - function should not be more than 7 lines long(main function can be 10 lines long max)
    - if your fuction is more than 7 lines long split it into  multiple functions.
    - function should follow the ORP(One Responsibility Principle) it should do only one thing and do
    it well.
12.Specific Imports
    - Only use specific files which you are using.
    - do not include "bits/stdc++.h" header file.
13.Tips
    -use modern syntax whenever possible
        for(auto x:students){
            cout<<x<<"\n";
        }
    - use classes over structs
    -//?Passing constant references as they are more efficient.

14.only do what is written in question not any extra stuff. eg. if there is nothing about user input
 then don't waste your time thinking about it.
15. while working on multiple variable names use a,a1,a2...
